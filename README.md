# Project 1_0: Introduction to Motor Control
This assignment will have you practice controlling motors through guided user interfaces like the Phoenix Tuner and the REV Client. 

## ***Instructions***
***Phoenix Tuner***

- Using the Phoenix Tuner, find the CAN ID of all motors on the 2019 robot. 
- Write the name/location of the motor as it appears on the Phoenix Tuner next to the id in a text file
- Make sure to place the robot on a box or suspend the robot in some other way such that the wheels are not touching the ground. 
- Using the Phoenix Tuner, run a motor on the drivetrain of the 2019 robot at 0.3 percent output on the 2019 robot. Plot the graph of velocity, position, and current. 
	- Take a screenshot/picture and attach the file

***REV Hardware Client***

- Using the SPARKMAX to NEO motor set up, run a neo at 0.3 percent output with the REV Hardware Client

***Submit by adding these files and committing them to your assignment repo.***
